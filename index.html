      content="Let's Catch Pokemons!. It displays a grid-based layout showcasing different Pokemon cards. Each card contains details about a specific Pokémon, including:

    Name: Displayed prominently at the top of each card.
    
    Type: Highlighted with color-coded labels (e.g., Grass, Poison, Fire).
    
    Attributes: Includes Height, Weight, Speed, Experience, Attack, and Ability.
    
    Search Functionality: A search bar is visible at the top, suggesting that users can filter Pokémon by name.
    
    
    The website has a polished, user-friendly interface with a dark theme and card-based design, making it visually engaging. It likely uses a dynamic API or database to fetch and display Pokémon details. This would be an excellent addition to a portfolio, showcasing front-end and API integration skills.
